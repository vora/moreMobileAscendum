  You may have certain rights relating to your Personal Information, subject to local data protection law. Whenever you use our Services, we aim to provide you with choices about how we use your Personal Information. We also aim to provide you with access to your Personal Information. If that information is wrong, we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it ? unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or legal purposes. Subject to applicable law, you may obtain a copy of Personal information we maintain about you or you may update or correct inaccuracies in that information by contacting us. To help protect your privacy and maintain security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting you access to the information.

The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.\
  Right to Data Portability. You have the right to a "portable" copy of your Personal Information that you have submitted to us. Generally, this means you have a right to request that we move, copy or transmit your Personal Information stored on our servers or information technology environment to another service provider's servers or information technology environment.\
  Right to Delete Your Data. You have the right to request that we delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions.

  These MORE User Terms ("Terms") govern your use of the products and services provided by or on behalf of Cantaloupe, Inc. ("Cantaloupe", "we", "our" or "us") pursuant to these Terms, including any content or information provided therewith (collectively, the "Services").\
  Our Privacy Policy, available here, is incorporated by reference into these Terms. Please read these Terms and the Privacy Policy carefully before you access the Services, as these Terms form a binding legal agreement between you and Cantaloupe.\
  These Terms may apply to you individually, the business or other legal entity user you represent, or both. If you are using the Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you hereby represent and warrant that you have the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of such entity. By accessing, registering for or using the Services, you: (1) acknowledge that you have read and understand these Terms; (2) agree to be bound by them in their entirety, and (3) are entering into a legally binding agreement with us. As used in these Terms and unless separately identified as applicable to either an individual or entity, "you" and "your" refer to both you individually and the entity on behalf of which you are entering into these Terms. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein are defined in Section 16.\
  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT USE THE SERVICES. YOUR USE OF OUR SERVICES REQUIRES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AS THEY MAY BE AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, INCLUDING THE POLICIES INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE HEREIN, WHICH INCLUDES THE CANTALOUPE PRIVACY POLICY.\
  1. Services.\
  1.1. Overview of Services. The Services enable you to manage your wallet (including adding and removing Payment Accounts for use in connection with your MORE Account), make payments at participating points of sale, receive and manage loyalty rewards, review account activity and perform other activities enabled by the Services from time to time in Cantaloupe's sole discretion, including the Transaction Service.\
  1.2. Additional Terms; Third-Party Terms. Your use of the Services and related services may be governed by additional terms, including third-party terms, conditions and privacy policies.\
  1.2.1. Privacy Policy. To use our Services, you must register with us and submit certain personally identifiable information. You expressly agree that we may collect, disclose, store and otherwise use your information in accordance with the terms of the Cantaloupe Privacy Policy, which is hereby incorporated by reference.\
  1.2.2. Prepaid Card Terms. To the extent you enroll, access or use any prepaid card or related account made available by Cantaloupe in connection with the Services, Cantaloupe's Prepaid & Loyalty (P&L) Card Terms and Conditions shall apply and are hereby incorporated by reference.\
  1.2.3. Credit/Debit Card Terms. To the extent you enroll a credit or debit card for use in connection with the Services, Cantaloupe's Loyalty & Rewards Program Terms and Conditions shall apply and are hereby incorporated by reference.\
  1.2.4. Bakkt Terms. The Services enable your use of a Bakkt account and related services ("Bakkt Services") in connection with the Services. Bakkt enables you to buy, sell, and use cryptocurrency in connection with the Services. The Bakkt Services are provided by a third-party and are subject to the corresponding agreements, including Bakkt's applicable privacy policy, which are between you and Bakkt. You acknowledge and agree that Cantaloupe is not responsible for, and you hereby hold Cantaloupe harmless from, the Bakkt Services and any issues arising therefrom. Section 1.12 below shall also apply to the Bakkt services.\
  1.2.5. Mastercard Merchant Funded Offers. To the extent MasterCard merchant-funded offers ("MC Offers") are made available to you in connection with the Services, the additional terms set forth in the MC Offers addendum at this end of these Terms apply to you.\
  1.2.6. Additional Third-Party Terms. The Services may also integrate with, incorporate or otherwise provide access to other third-party products and services. Such third-party services and products are subject to Section 1.12 below.\
  1.3. Establishing a MORE Account. When you accept these Terms (for example, when first registering a Payment Account through the Services), you are creating a MORE Account. Depending on the Services you use, you may be asked to provide information such as your name, contact information, Payment Account information (including your bank name, routing number and account number for the account, if applicable), date of birth, and/or your social security number. Cantaloupe may verify your registration information with a third-party verification service provider. We may also ask you to answer additional questions to help us verify your identity or provide additional information, such as a copy of your photo ID (e.g. driver's license or passport). The information you provide will be used to determine if you are eligible to use the Services. In order to use the Transaction Service and make Transactions, you must provide all information required and register a valid Payment Account. You authorize Cantaloupe to confirm that your Payment Account is in good standing with the issuing financial institution, including by submitting a request for a payment authorization and/or a low dollar credit and/or debit to the Payment Account in accordance with the relevant card association rules. Cantaloupe may refuse to approve, or may terminate existing, registrations for the Transaction Service with or without cause or notice to the extent permitted by applicable law.\
  1.4. Transaction Service. The Transaction Service facilitates a purchase by a Purchaser (using a Payment Account) from a Seller that is registered with, or otherwise enabled by, Cantaloupe or its customers or partners to receive certain payment processing services. The Transaction Service stores information from Purchasers, such as their Payment Accounts. When Purchaser chooses to pay for Products with the Transaction Service, Purchaser authorizes the Seller to submit charges (and, in the case of refunds, credits) to Purchaser's registered Payment Account. Cantaloupe may assist the Seller in accessing a payment network and processing the Transaction. Once Purchaser's registered Payment Account is authorized, Purchaser's payment obligation to Seller shall be deemed completed and discharged (except for Purchaser's obligations in the event of a chargeback or other reversal). Purchases made through the Transaction Service are also subject to the terms and conditions governing Purchaser's Payment Account between Purchaser and the issuer of the Payment Account. Purchaser is responsible for any charges and related fees that may be imposed under the Payment Account terms and conditions as a result of Purchaser's use of a Payment Account. You acknowledge and agree that your purchases of Products are transactions between you and the Seller, and not with Cantaloupe. Cantaloupe is not a party to your Transaction for the purchase of Products, and Cantaloupe is not a Purchaser or a Seller in connection with any Transaction, unless expressly designated as such in the listing of the Product. You also agree that Cantaloupe may update your Payment Account information, including expiration date and card number, due to information received under certain account updater programs created by payment networks. Under these programs, enrolled card issuers and merchants can provide and receive up-to-date payment card-related information from payment networks regarding your Payment Accounts stored by Cantaloupe. Cantaloupe may reflect these changes to your stored Payment Account to prevent payment failure or service termination. You also agree that a Seller and Cantaloupe, acting on behalf of the Seller, may resubmit a Transaction for a Product purchase to the payment network for processing one or more times in the event that a prior Transaction is declined or returned by the payment network.\
  1.5. Transaction Service Fees. Cantaloupe does not charge a fee to use the Transaction Service as a Purchaser. The financial institution that issues your Payment Account may charge a fee in connection with the debiting or charging of the Payment Account resulting from the Transaction. You should consult the terms and conditions governing your Payment Account for more information about any such fees.\
  1.6. Refunds. Except as set forth in these Terms, all Transactions processed through the Transaction Service are non-refundable to Purchaser by Cantaloupe and are non-reversible by Purchaser through the Transaction Service. You may have additional refund or charge-back rights under your Payment Account issuer agreement or applicable state and federal laws. You should review your periodic statement received from the issuer of your Payment Account which will reflect all purchase transactions through the Transaction Service.\
  1.7. Permissible Transactions. You may only use the Transaction Service to process a Transaction for a Product that is purchased from a Seller through a legitimate, bona fide sale of the Product. The Transaction Service may not be used to process a Transaction, or otherwise transfer money between a Purchaser and Seller, that is unrelated to a purchase of a Product. The Transaction Service may not be used to receive cash advances from Sellers or to facilitate the purchase of cash equivalents (travelers checks, prepaid cards, money orders, etc.). You may not use the Transaction Service to purchase any illegal goods or services or for any other underlying illegal transaction. You agree that you will not use the Transaction Service to purchase any Products that violate these Terms, other policies or rules applicable to the Transaction Service, or applicable law. Failure to comply with these limitations may result in suspension or termination of your use of the Transaction Service.\
  1.8. No Endorsement of Products. Cantaloupe does not represent or endorse, and shall not be responsible for: (a) the reliability or performance of any Seller, merchant or Third Party Provider; (b) the safety, quality, accuracy, reliability, integrity or legality of any Products; (c) the truth or accuracy of the description of any Product, or of any advice, opinion, offer, proposal, statement, data or other information (collectively, "TP Content") displayed or distributed, purchased or paid through the Services; or (d) your ability to buy Products using the Services. Cantaloupe hereby disclaims any liability or responsibility for errors or omissions in any TP Content. Cantaloupe reserves the right, but shall have no responsibility, to edit, modify, refuse to post or remove any TP Content, in whole or in part, that in its sole and absolute discretion is objectionable, erroneous, illegal, fraudulent or otherwise in violation of these Terms.\
  1.9. Not a Banking Institution or Issuer. Cantaloupe is not a bank or other chartered depository institution. Except as otherwise expressly contemplated, Cantaloupe is not an issuer of any Payment Account. These Terms do not amend or otherwise modify your agreement with the issuer of your Payment Account, and you are responsible for ensuring your use of the Services complies with such agreements. Use of the Services is not approved by or offered in conjunction with the issuer of your Payment Account. Your Payment Account issuer may impose fees, transaction limits, or other limitations on transactions incurred using the Services. In the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and your agreement with the issuer of your Payment Account, these Terms govern the relationship between you and Cantaloupe solely with respect to the Services, and your agreement with the issuer of your Payment Account governs the relationship between you and the issuer of such item. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the Payment Account, and any other information you enter or otherwise store in connection with the Services. Cantaloupe is not responsible for the accuracy or availability of any information you enter or otherwise store with the Services, including, without limitation, whether such information is current and up-to-date.\
  1.10. Communication with Issuers. By electing to use the Services, you authorize Cantaloupe, directly or through such Services, to communicate with the issuer of your Payment Account to provide or obtain any information required by that issuer. In providing this information, an issuer does not endorse and is not responsible for the Services.\
  1.11. Third Party Providers. Cantaloupe may arrange for third-party providers to provide Products to you through the Services ("Third Party Providers"). In order to use these Products, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions from those Third Party Providers, and may be subject to additional requirements of the Third Party Provider. By agreeing to these Terms or continuing to use the Services, you hereby agree to any Third Party Provider terms that apply to your use of such Products and the Services, which may be updated from time to time. For avoidance of doubt, these Third Party Provider terms are between you and the applicable Third Party Provider, not Cantaloupe. We may, but do not have any obligation to, block information, transmissions or access to certain information, services, products or domains to protect the Services, our network, the public or our users. We are not a publisher of third-party content accessed through the Services and are not responsible for the content, accuracy, timeliness or delivery of any opinions, advice, statements, messages, services, graphics, data or any other information provided to or by third parties as accessible through the Services.\
  1.12. Sharing Payment Account Details with Third Parties. Where requested by you, Cantaloupe may pass details of your Payment Account and related information to a third party for that third party to charge the Payment Account for goods or services it will supply to you. You acknowledge and agree that your purchases made are transactions between you and the third party and not with Cantaloupe. You should contact the third party or your Payment Account issuer directly regarding any issues with such third-party transactions, including refunds and disputes.\
  1.13. Geo-Location Data. Cantaloupe may use your geo-location data if you authorize Cantaloupe to do so. Additionally, the Services may incorporate an API for a mapping or location service. If such a service is incorporated, by accessing or using our Services, you hereby agree to be bound by terms of service and privacy policy applicable to that service.\
  1.14. Disclaimer. CANTALOUPE IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACCURACY OF ANY PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WHETHER SUCH INFORMATION IS CURRENT AND UP-TO-DATE. WITHOUT LIMITING THE GENERALITY OF THE PRECEDING SENTENCE, YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT SUCH INFORMATION IS REPORTED BY THE ISSUER AS OF A PARTICULAR TIME ESTABLISHED BY THE ISSUER AND MAY NOT ACCURATELY REFLECT YOUR CURRENT TRANSACTIONS, AVAILABLE BALANCE, OR OTHER ACCOUNT OR PROGRAM DETAILS AT THE TIME THEY ARE DISPLAYED TO YOU THROUGH THE SERVICES OR AT THE TIME YOU MAKE A PURCHASE. YOU MAY INCUR FEES, SUCH AS OVERDRAFT FEES OR OTHER CHARGES AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRANSACTIONS, PER YOUR AGREEMENT WITH YOUR PAYMENT ACCOUNT ISSUER, OR YOUR ATTEMPT TO MAKE A PURCHASE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.\

  Excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable relief, for any claim where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000, the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online or be solely based on written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not require any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise mutually agreed by the parties. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.

Offers will be valid for use by consumers with an Enrolled Card issued in the United States, unless otherwise permitted by the Offer Terms, and only during the time period applicable to such offer.\
  2. Data Rights. Mastercard and Cantaloupe may leverage hashed emails and geolocation to segment or target offers. The geolocation may include the ZIP code provided for the Enrolled Card and/or location data provided by a device (e.g. mobile). Without limiting the Privacy Policy, you acknowledge and agrees that Mastercard and Cantaloupe may use your data for the purposes of: (a) providing the MC Offers to you and performing its obligations under these Terms; (b) enhancing the MC Offers and related services; (c) preparing internal reports for use by Cantaloupe, Mastercard, their affiliates, and their staff, management, and consultants; (d) preparing and furnishing compilations, analyses, and other reports for Cantaloupe, Mastercard, their affiliates, or merchants, including reporting to participating merchants on your qualifying transactions to which the specific data relates; (e) preparing and furnishing aggregated and anonymized analyses and reporting for participating and prospective merchants for the purpose of marketing or advertising the MC Offers program; (f) complying with applicable legal requirements; and (g) assisting law enforcement agencies by responding to requests for the disclosure of personal information, in accordance with applicable local laws.

Neither Mastercard nor Cantaloupe shall have any obligation to fulfill such a MC Offer that was not accepted by you or for which the other specified requirements were not met.\
  5. Consent; Opt-Out. By enrolling your applicable card for use in connection with MC Offers and agreeing to these Terms, you hereby consent to participation in the MC Offers program and allowing Mastercard and Cantaloupe to monitor your transaction action activity, including for the purposes of fulfilling offers and any other related uses, such as targeting offers that may be of interest to you.
